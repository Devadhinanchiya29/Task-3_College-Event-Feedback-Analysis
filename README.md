Analyze student event feedback collected via Google Forms to:
- Understand satisfaction levels
- Perform sentiment analysis
- Suggest improvements based on textual responses

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Google Colab  
- 🗂 pandas  
- 💬 TextBlob (Sentiment Analysis)  
- 📈 seaborn & matplotlib (Visualization)

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name                         | Description                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `feedback_data.csv`              | Original dataset from Google Forms          |
| `College_Feedback_Analysis.ipynb`| Python notebook for sentiment analysis      |
| `Feedback_Sentiment_Result.csv`  | Final output with polarity and sentiment    |

## 📊 Key Steps Performed

- Loaded and cleaned the feedback dataset  
- Applied **TextBlob** to analyze sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)  
- Visualized sentiment distribution using seaborn  
- Interpreted insights from both:
  - "Liked About Event" responses
  - "Improvement Suggestions" feedback

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Helped identify how students feel about the event
- Gave improvement directions based on real feedback
- Developed hands-on skills in NLP, data cleaning, and visualization
